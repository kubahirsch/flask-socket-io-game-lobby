# Game Lobby for a WORDFIGHTER

This is a basic fundament for the WORDFIGHT game

Created by Kuba Hirsch

## Goal

The goal is to create a web game for people to train and test their ability to use sophiticated words. For now it's just a simple lobby to test socket io.

## Current state

The project is just in my head and I thought the biggest problem will be to have a live score of both players. But then I discovered how web sockets 
and socket io works. Now it seems easy so I stopped making a project.

## Requirements

## Installation 👩‍💻

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run py main.py and open localhost:5000 in browser

## Ways to improve 📈

The game lobby still doesn't work properly.

I want to add:
1.  You can't write anything in chat unless both players join
2.  You can't join lobby if there are already two players 
3.
